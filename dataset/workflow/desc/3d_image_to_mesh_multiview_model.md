This workflow starts by loading a reference image (Cat_Coffee_rgba.png) and mask from the LoadImage node, followed by applying a mask inversion operation. The workflow utilizes a loaded large multiview Gaussian model (model_fp16.safetensors) and a diffusers pipeline (MVDreamPipeline from ashawkey/imagedream-ipmv-diffusers) to generate multiview images through the MVDream model. The generated multiview images are then fitted to create a 3D Gaussian point cloud (3DGS), which is subsequently converted into a 3D mesh using NeRF and marching cubes techniques. The resulting mesh and point clouds are saved (LGMTest/FatCat.obj and LGMTest/FatCat.ply), and options are provided for previewing both 3D mesh and 3DGS data.
