The process begins by setting up the required inputs and models. The downloadandloadcogvideomodel_36 node loads the primary CogVideo model (THUDM/CogVideoX-5b) and its associated VAE (vae_36), configured for efficient video generation with bf16 precision, attention mode set to sdpa and quantization set to fp8_e4m3fn. At the same time, the cliploader_20 node loads a CLIP model (t5xxl_fp16.safetensors) for encoding text prompts. The prompts are encoded through two nodes: cogvideotextencode_30 processes a detailed description of the desired scene involving a golden retriever, generating positive conditioning (conditioning_30) using the loaded CLIP model (clip_20), while cogvideotextencode_31 generates neutral or negative conditioning (conditioning_31) based on an empty prompt.Next, the emptylatentimage_37 node creates an empty latent space (latent_37) for the video frames with a resolution of 720x480 and a batch size of 1. The cogvideosampler_35 node uses the CogVideo model (model_36) to generate a sequence of 7 latent frames (samples_35) based on the positive and negative conditions (conditioning_30 and conditioning_31). This process incorporates 20 denoising steps, guided by the specified configuration (cfg=6) and a fixed scheduler.The latent frames are then decoded into actual images (images_11) by the cogvideodecode_11 node, which uses the VAE (vae_36) to reconstruct frames from latent space. Tiling parameters are adjusted for efficiency, though tiling is disabled by default in this setup. Finally, the saveanimatedwebp_38 node compiles these images into an animated WebP file, with a frame rate of 6 FPS, lossless compression enabled, and a quality setting of 80. The resulting file captures the golden retriever scene described in the input prompt, rendered as a smooth animation.
