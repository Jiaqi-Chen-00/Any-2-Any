This workflow uses ConditioningSetArea and ConditioningCombine nodes to paint objects in a specific area of the image. With the image size and target position specified, the workflow masks and combines the conditioning so that the object will be placed in the desired area. In this example, we generate a photo of Godzilla raising from the water near a Caribbean beach, where beach is placed in the left half and Godzilla is placed in the right half. To generate an image correctly, different areas should overlap and combined conditioning should cover the entire image area.
