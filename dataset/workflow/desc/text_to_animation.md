This workflow uses AnimateDiff to generate animations from text descriptions. With the screen size and frame number specified, the workflow uses the batch prompt node to describe the animation contents in those specific key frames, so that a temporal-consistent animation corresponding to the text description can be generated. In this example, we animate a smiling girl, with her eyes winking and wind blowing her hair. Image size of around 512x512 is recommended. Extremely large image size will lead to defective results.
