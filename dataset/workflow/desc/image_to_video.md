This workflow uses multiple nodes based on Stable Video Diffusion to generate a video from an image. Given an image, the workflow will convert it into video conditioning and corresponding latent code, which will be fed into the sampler and decoder to generate the video. In this example, we generate a video of mountains based on the given image and save it to a webp file using SaveAnimatedWEBP. Image size of 1024x576, 14 frames and 6 frames per second are recommended for the best results.
