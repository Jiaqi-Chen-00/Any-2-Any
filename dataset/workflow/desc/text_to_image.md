This workflow presents a basic pipeline of text-to-image generation using Stable Diffusion. Given the positive and negative prompts, the workflow will load the pretrained models, encode the prompts into conditioning, create and denoise the latent code, and finally decode the latent code into an image. In this example, we generate a photo of a cat wearing a spacesuit inside a spaceship, while avoiding blurry and illustration-like results.
