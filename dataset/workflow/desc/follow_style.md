This workflow uses CLIPVisionEncode and unCLIPConditioning nodes to follow the style of the given image. Given a reference image, the workflow encodes it with the CLIP vision model and then converts it into conditioning, which will be combined with the text prompt. In this example, we provide an image of Budapest and follow its style to generate a beautiful photograph of an old European city.
