This workflow uses ControlNets based on depth map and line art to edit details in an image, such as expressions, ornaments, and painting styles, where the result image tends to follow the original image faithfully and large-scale modification is unrealizable. Given an image, the source prompt describes the original appearance and the destination prompt describes the desired appearance. Then the workflow will try to make some modifications in detail according to the expected effects. In this example, we add a pair of sunglasses to the girl in the image.
