This workflow uses the Triplane Gaussian Transformers model to generate a 3D mesh from a 2D reference image, "PirateCat.png." It begins by loading the model and the image, then inverts the mask to enhance object-background separation. Using Triplane Gaussian Transformers, the workflow creates an initial 3D geometry with a specified camera distance, followed by an axis transformation to align the model orientation. The 3D geometry is then refined into a detailed mesh using NeRF and Marching Cubes algorithms, with configurable settings for resolution and texture. Finally, the generated 3D model is saved as "pirate_cat.obj" for further use.
