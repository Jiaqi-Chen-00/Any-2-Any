This workflow uses ControlNets based on line art to edit contents in an image, such as objects, colors, and themes, where the input image can be effectively modified according to the prompt. Given an image, the prompt describes the desired effects, and the workflow will try to generate the desired image based on the input image. In this example, we generate a logo with bright colors for a game app based on an image of the letter "R".
