This workflow follows an image-to-image outpainting paradigm. It extends an input image, \"iceberg.jpg\", by padding 256 pixels to the left and right sides and then generates the extended regions using a generative model. The output is an iceberg image with newly generated left and right expansions. The workflow first pads the input image by 256 pixels on both left and right sides using the \"ImagePadForOutpaint\" node, preparing the image for outpainting. The padded image is then encoded into a latent representation using a VAE model, considering the padded regions. The generative model \"dreamshaper_8Inpainting\" is used to sample from the latent space and generate the new parts of the image, guided by the conditioning text prompt \"an image of iceberg\" and avoiding undesired elements specified in the negative prompt. The result is decoded back into an extended image.
