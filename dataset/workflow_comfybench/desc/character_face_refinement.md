This workflow performs image-to-image character face enhancement. Given an input image, it detects the face and refines it, generating a high-quality output with improved facial details while preserving the context of the original image. The workflow first loads an input image (\"woman_portrait.jpg\") and applies a face detection model (\"bbox/face_yolov8m.pt\") along with a SAM model (\"sam_vit_b_01ec64.pth\") to locate the face in the image. The \"FaceDetailer\" node is then used to refine facial features utilizing the \"majicmixRealistic_v7.safetensors\" model. It integrates text conditioning to apply specific aesthetics (\"1girl\" as positive, \"lowres, zombie, horror, nsfw\" as negatives) and uses inpainting to enhance facial details, leading to a smoothly upscaled result with high fidelity in the face area. The final image is saved with the improved face region.
