This workflow follows a sketch-to-image paradigm, where it takes a scribble image (\"simple_graffiti.png\") along with a text prompt (\"a bird, open wings\") and generates a detailed, high-quality image based on both the scribble and the prompt.The workflow first loads and inverts the input scribble image. The inverted image is then used by a \"control_v11p_sd15_scribble_fp16\" ControlNet model to extract and applied to the scribble, controlling and guiding the image generation process. A pre-trained model (\"dreamshaper_8.safetensors\") processes the positive conditioning generated by the combination of the text prompt and the ControlNet's output, along with negative conditioning from undesired traits such as \"horror\" and \"lowres.\" The latent space image is generated using a KSampler and further decoded by the VAE to form the final image. The model synthesizes a highly detailed image while adhering closely to both the shape of the scribble and the desired features implied by the text prompt.
