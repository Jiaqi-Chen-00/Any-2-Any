This workflow follows an image-to-video paradigm. It requires an input image (in this case, \"play_guitar.jpg\") and generates a 4-second video at 6 frames per second (24 video frames in total) based on that image. The workflow outputs the generated video. The workflow uses the \"svd_xt_1_1.safetensors\" Stable Video Diffusion model to generate a video from the input image \"play_guitar.jpg\". The \"SVD_img2vid_Conditioning\" node creates the necessary conditioning for video generation, including the number of frames, resolution, and motion characteristics. A KSamplerAdvanced node adds noise and performs generative sampling over multiple steps to create diverse video frames. These frames are then decoded back into images via a VAE, and finally, the \"SaveAnimatedWEBP\" node compiles these images into a 4-second video at 8 frames per second.
