This workflow upscales the input image \"titled_book.png\" by 2x, resulting in a high-resolution version of the original image. It enhances the image quality while maintaining visual details. The workflow first loads the \"4x-UltraSharp.pth\" upscale model, which upscales the image by 4x. To achieve a final 2x upscale factor, the workflow subsequently reduces the image scale by 0.5x using bilinear interpolation, ensuring that the output image retains the characteristics of a smoothly upscaled 2x image.
