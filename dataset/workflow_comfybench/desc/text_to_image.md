This workflow implements a basic text-to-image generation pipeline using Stable Diffusion. It requires both positive (desired traits) and negative (undesired traits) text prompts to generate an image. In this specific case, the workflow will output a high-resolution photo of a cat wearing a spacesuit inside a spaceship, avoiding blurry or illustration-like effects.The workflow begins by loading the \"dreamshaper_8.safetensors\" Stable Diffusion model. It generates a blank latent space as the starting point for the image generation. The positive prompt (\"a photo of a cat wearing a spacesuit inside a spaceship\") and negative prompt (\"blurry, illustration\") are encoded into conditioning by the CLIPTextEncode node. The KSampler node then uses these conditionings to guide the generative process over 20 sampling steps, applying denoising to the latent space. The resulting latent code is subsequently decoded into an image using the VAE and saved to disk.
