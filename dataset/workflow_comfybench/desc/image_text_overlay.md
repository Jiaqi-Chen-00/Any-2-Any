This workflow generates a blank black image (512x512) and overlays a white text (\"Hello, world!\") at the center of the image. The workflow first creates a black image using the \"EmptyImage\" node. Then, it uses the \"CR Overlay Text\" node to overlay the white text \"Hello, world!\" onto the center of this image. This involves setting parameters such as font size, font color, and text alignment to customize the appearance of the text.
