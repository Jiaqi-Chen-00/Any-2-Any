This workflow is designed for object removal in images. It requires an input image and a text prompt specifying the object to be removed. The output will be the image with the selected object removed and the area inpainted seamlessly. The workflow first uses the GroundingDINO model and SAM (Segment Anything Model) to segment the object specified in the prompt from the input image (\"bedroom.jpg\") and generate a mask of the object (in this case, a chair). The workflow then expands the mask slightly using the \"GrowMask\" node for a better inpainting result. Finally, the LaMa object removal model is applied to remove the masked object and inpaint the area where the object was located, blending it into the surrounding environment.
