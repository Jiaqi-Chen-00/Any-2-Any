This workflow is an image-to-image editing pipeline that repaints an image with subtle modifications. It allows for adjusting details such as expressions, ornaments, or painting styles while keeping the main structure of the image intact. It requires an input image, a source prompt describing the original image, and a destination prompt describing the desired changes. In this case, it adds a pair of sunglasses to the girl in the original image.The workflow extracts both line art and depth map features using the \"LineArtPreprocessor\" and \"Zoe-DepthMapPreprocessor\" to guide the ControlNet models. It loads two ControlNets: one based on depth and one on line art, and applies these networks in combination with conditioning from the source and destination prompts to modulate the latent image. The BNK_Unsampler is used with no added noise to maintain the original structure of the image but to refine it based on the destination prompt. The KSamplerAdvanced node then further processes the latent representation without introducing additional noise to ensure minimal deviation from the original image, resulting in a subtly repainted image.
