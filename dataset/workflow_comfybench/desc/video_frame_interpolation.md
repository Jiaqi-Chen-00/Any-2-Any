This workflow performs video frame interpolation using the RIFE VFI model. It takes an input video such as \"play_guitar.gif\", increases the frame rate by generating intermediate frames (interpolating) with a multiplier (in this case, 3x), and produces a smoother video with a higher frame rate (from 8 to 24 frames per second). The final output is saved as a new video or animated GIF. The workflow first loads the input video using \"VHS_LoadVideo\", which extracts the individual frames. The \"RIFE VFI\" node is then used to interpolate the frames by generating additional frames between the existing ones. In this scenario, the multiplier is set to 3x, effectively tripling the frame count and enabling a smoother video playback at 24 frames per second. Finally, the interpolated frames are combined into a video or GIF format using \"SaveAnimatedWEBP\".
