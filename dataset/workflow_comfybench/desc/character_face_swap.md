This workflow performs a face swap operation between two images: a target image \"target.jpg\" and a source image \"source.jpg\". After swapping the face from the source image to the target image, the resulting image is upscaled to a higher resolution. The face swap is executed using the \"ReActorFaceSwap\" node, which replaces the face in the target image with the face from the source image. It utilizes advanced detection, alignment, and blending techniques for realistic results. The face swap process uses the \"inswapper_128.onnx\" model for swapping and applies the \"codeformer-v0.1.0.pth\" for face restoration. After the face is swapped, the resulting image is enhanced using the \"4x-UltraSharp.pth\" upscale model, making the final output image clearer and higher in resolution.
