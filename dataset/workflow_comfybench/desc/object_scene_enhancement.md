This workflow follows an image-to-image paradigm to remove the background from an input image, integrate the main object into a new scene (urban roadside at night), and adjust the lighting, shadows, and highlights to harmonize the object with the new environment. The input is an image with a subject (e.g., \"titled_book.png\"), and the output is an enhanced image where the subject appears naturally within the described nighttime urban scene. The background of the input image is first removed using the \"easy_imageRemBg\" node. The object is resized and placed within a blank latent image. A new scene is described (\"Urban roadside night view\") and encoded using a CLIP model as conditioning input. The workflow then applies an IPAdapter model and an IC-Light Unet model to refine the lighting and integrate realistic highlights and shadows into the composited scene. Finally, detail transfer is applied to enhance the texture of the object so that it fits seamlessly with the new background.
