- `KSampler`: The KSampler node is designed for advanced sampling operations within generative models, allowing for the customization of sampling processes through various parameters. It facilitates the generation of new data samples by manipulating latent space representations, leveraging conditioning, and adjusting noise levels.
    - Parameters:
        - `seed`: Controls the randomness of the sampling process, ensuring reproducibility of results when set to a specific value. Type should be `INT`.
        - `control_after_generate`: Provides the ability to change the seed number after each prompt, such as `fixed` or `randomize`. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `steps`: Determines the number of steps to be taken in the sampling process, affecting the detail and quality of the generated samples. Type should be `INT`.
        - `cfg`: Adjusts the conditioning factor, influencing the direction and strength of the conditioning applied during sampling. Type should be `FLOAT`.
        - `sampler_name`: Selects the specific sampling algorithm to be used, impacting the behavior and outcome of the sampling process. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `scheduler`: Chooses the scheduling algorithm for controlling the sampling process, affecting the progression and dynamics of sampling. Type should be `COMBO[STRING]`.
        - `denoise`: Controls the level of denoising applied to the samples, affecting the clarity and sharpness of the generated images. Type should be `FLOAT`.
    - Inputs:
        - `model`: Specifies the generative model to be used for sampling, playing a crucial role in determining the characteristics of the generated samples. Type should be `MODEL`.
        - `positive`: Defines positive conditioning to guide the sampling towards desired attributes or features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `negative`: Specifies negative conditioning to steer the sampling away from certain attributes or features. Type should be `CONDITIONING`.
        - `latent_image`: Provides a latent space representation to be used as a starting point or reference for the sampling process. Type should be `LATENT`.
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: Represents the latent space output of the sampling process, encapsulating the generated samples. Type should be `LATENT`.
