- `EmptyLatentImage`: The EmptyLatentImage node is designed to generate a blank latent space representation with specified dimensions and batch size. This node serves as a foundational step in generating or manipulating images in latent space, providing a starting point for further image synthesis or modification processes.
    - Parameters:
        - `width`: Specifies the width of the latent image to be generated. This parameter directly influences the spatial dimensions of the resulting latent representation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `height`: Determines the height of the latent image to be generated. This parameter is crucial for defining the spatial dimensions of the latent space representation. Type should be `INT`.
        - `batch_size`: Controls the number of latent images to be generated in a single batch. This allows for the generation of multiple latent representations simultaneously, facilitating batch processing. Type should be `INT`.
    - Inputs:
    - Outputs:
        - `latent`: The output is a tensor representing a batch of blank latent images, serving as a base for further image generation or manipulation in latent space. Type should be `LATENT`.
